# Transport in groundwater #

_(based on lecture 9 of HSE GW course_)

The **transport** is the second among the three components of our course.  

The **Transport** in groundwater deals with quantification of any component that flows along with the groundwater. The compoents can be living organisms, e.g., bacteria, virus; chemicals, e.g., oil, CO$_2$ or porous media, e.g., sand, soil

Thus, one differentiates between groundwater **flow** - as studies related with only water as against **transport** - related to components flowing along with groundwater.  In terms of unit of measurements, the flow studies deals with volumetric unit [L$^3$], whereas transport study deals with qunatification of mass [M] often as per unit volume of groundwater or concentration [ML$^{-3}$]. **Space** and **time** are fundamental variables in both flow and transport studies.

The _transport_ in groundwater can be categorized into the two following group.

1. Conservative transport 
2. Reactive transport 

We start with a clear destinctions between the two tranports.

## Conservative and reactive transport systems ## 

**Conservative transport system** is when there is
- no interaction with aquifer solid material,
- no interaction with other chemicals,
- no interaction with living organisms (e.g., bacteria)

When either of the above interaction is part of the process, then the system is **reactive**.


In the course, the conservative transport will introduce fundamental transport processes such as **advection**, **mechanical dispersion** and **diffusion**. Then in the reactive transport, these processes will be combined with reaction processes such as **sorption**, **degradation**. Eventually, fundamental equation for modeling transport (conservative and reactive) will be developed.
