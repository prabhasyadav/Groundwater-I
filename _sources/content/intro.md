# The Interactive Groundwater-I Book


The site will provide interactive JUPYTER notebook and the text-contents of a typical basic groundwater course taught at higher UG level or the early PG level at universities. 

The contents are geared towards learning through computing. The computing part is entirely based on Python programming language. Only very basic Python programming is required to be known. 

The contents are divided into:
1. Lecture Parts
2. Tutorial Parts

The lecture parts contains mostly texts [markdown][Kramdown] format and the notebooks (.ipynb). The notebooks can be interacted in the browser.
